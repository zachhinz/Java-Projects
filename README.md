# Java-Projects
Projects in Java. Made as part of my Data Structures and Advanced Programming class. 

# Calculator
Text based calculator which uses postfix notation and doubly linked 
lists in Java. Part of my Data Structures and Advanced Programming 
Course. Calculator is the central class with the main method and it 
includes an instantiation of the CalculatorMemory class. The operation 
class performs the correct mathematical operation based on the two input
 integers and the sign inputed.

# Compression
Creates and maintains a matrix of values, and updates values as necessary. 
Holds this in memory as a Doubly Linked List, where each node of the list states where a
sequence of entries of the same value begins. If we have AAA, we only need one node which remebers
the starting point of that sequence.

# Silver Dollar Game
Graphical implementation of the silver dollar game using Java. Coin describes the features of the particular features of the coin, Coinstrip the features of the coinstrip, and GraphicsCoinStrip holds the main method while also ensuring that no rules are violated.
